# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.


#a list of kitten names
#looping through the kitten names
    #extracting the kitten name
    #printing that the value of this variable "is cute"
