# Python-101-Introduction-to-Python

## Repository Overview
This repository contains my completed work for **[Python 101 - Introduction to Python](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-101-introduction-to-python)**, the first module in the **[Python Web Development Career Track](https://codingnomads.com/online-courses/python-bootcamp-web-development)** by [CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.com/).  

The course provided a comprehensive introduction to programming with [Python](https://www.python.org/), beginning with the fundamentals and progressing to practical projects.  

This repository reflects my independent learning journey, including:
- Lesson notes and exercises  
- Quizzes and challenges  
- [Projects](#projects-and-technical-exercises) (automation scripts & games)  
- Technical writing practice  

It demonstrates my progress in problem-solving, control flow, file automation, and interactive applications with Python.

## Projects and Technical Exercises
Here are the main projects I completed during this module:

---

### [Screenshot Mover Script](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101/blob/main/labs/projects/mover/mover.py)
**Objective:** Automate the organisation of `.png` files by moving them into a new subdirectory.  

- **Core concepts used:**  
  - `pathlib.Path` for directory management  
  - `iterdir()` for iteration  
  - File filtering via `.suffix`  
  - File moving via `.rename()`  

---

### [Text-Based Dungeons and Dragons Game](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-python-101/blob/main/labs/projects/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py/dungeons_and_dragon_game.py)
**Objective:** Build a text-based adventure game using Python fundamentals.  

- **Core concepts used:**  
  - User input & string concatenation  
  - Conditional logic for branching game outcomes  
  - Booleans to track player state  
  - Variables for game conditions
