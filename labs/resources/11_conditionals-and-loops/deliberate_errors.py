# print(3 + "2")
print("3" + 2)
# when trying to add the number to the letter, it reads the code from left to right 
# the issue with the first one is adding something which isn't a number 
# the issue with the second one is that numbers can't be concatinated into strings, unless they are also in quotation marks
